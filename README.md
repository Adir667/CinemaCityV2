# JavaFX Starter

This project is meant to be a simple starter for JavaFX 17 under Maven. 
It's not comprehensive, and it doesn't build to a runnable jar... yet.

It is not assumed that you have Maven installed on your own machine,
this project only runs in the Maven tab in IntelliJ (I'm assuming your are using that).

Instructions:

1. Clone this project
2. Open up the Maven tab (on the right side of your screen)
3. Perform: LifeCycle > clean + install
4. Perform: Plugins > javafx > javafx:run
5. Customize to your own needs
